 # **Binary search algorithm**
---

binary search algorithm built using python
Binary search algorithm is an algorithm which helps us to sort an ordered list faster than just scanning through every single element to get the target which is very tiring and time consuming. 
This Algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. 
Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. 
If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned. 
If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item. 
Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. 
This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces to zero.
Along the way, this will be compared with Naive search and prove that Binary search is way faster than Naive search
Naive patterns checks for all the characters of the main string to the pattern.

# **Application**
---
* This algorithm is used to search element in a given sorted array with more efficiency.
* It could also be used for few other additional operations for example, to find the smallest element in the array or to find the largest element in the array.
