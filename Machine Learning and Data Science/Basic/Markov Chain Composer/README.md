# **Markov Chain Composer**

the markov chain composer is also known as graph composer.
the idea of graph composer is derived from a markov chain and so in a markov chain, you have a node that represent a value and it has an arrow pointing to another node that represent another value and that will point to another node which might point back to the first one and so on. so it kind of creat a network of nodes and directed edges with weight.
